[00:06.13] You're here where you should be
[00:09.04] Snow is falling as the carolers sing
[00:12.10] It just wasn't the same
[00:15.18] Alone on Christmas day
[00:18.07] Presents, what a beautiful sight
[00:21.12] Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
[00:24.13] You're all that I need
[00:27.02] Underneath the tree
[00:36.52] 
[00:29.91] Tonight I'm gonna hold you close
[00:36.19] Make sure that you know
[00:39.21] I was lost before you
[00:43.83] Christmas was cold and grey
[00:48.07] Another holiday alone to celebrate
[01:05.07] 
[00:53.85] But then one day everything changed
[00:59.32] You're all I need
[01:01.52] Underneath the tree
[01:11.02] 
[01:03.28] You're here where you should be
[01:06.10] Snow is falling as the carolers sing
[01:08.90] It just wasn't the same
[01:12.04] Alone on Christmas day
[01:15.16] Presents, what a beautiful sight
[01:18.07] Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
[01:21.29] You're all that I need
[01:24.02] Underneath the tree
[01:33.52] 
[01:26.98] I found what I was looking for
[01:33.08] A love that's meant for me
[01:36.06] A heart that's mine completely
[01:40.83] Knocked me right off my feet
[01:44.93] And this year I will fall
[01:48.14] With no worries at all
[01:59.14] 
[01:50.77] 'Cause you are near and everything's clear
[01:56.45] You're all I need
[01:58.69] Underneath the tree
[02:08.19] 
[01:59.98] You're here where you should be
[02:03.03] Snow is falling as the carolers sing
[02:05.96] It just wasn't the same
[02:09.00] Alone on Christmas day
[02:12.27] Presents, what a beautiful sight
[02:15.08] Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
[02:18.11] You're all that I need
[02:21.27] Underneath the tree
[02:30.77] 
[02:47.81] And then one day, everything changed
[02:53.55] You're all I need
[02:55.64] Underneath the tree
[03:05.14] 
[02:57.25] You're here where you should be (oh yeah)
[03:00.07] Snow is falling as the carolers sing
[03:02.67] (Oh yeah!) It just wasn't the same
[03:05.54] (Oh yeah!) Alone on Christmas day
[03:09.17] Presents, what a beautiful sight (oh, you're all I need)
[03:12.47] Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
[03:14.28] (Underneath the tree) you're all that I need
[03:17.23] (Underneath my tree) underneath the tree
[03:20.83] Tonight
[03:24.33] 
[03:22.79] Oh you're all I need!
[03:28.17] All I need underneath my tree
[03:35.72] Oh
